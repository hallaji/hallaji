  <b>Bueno</b><br />
</p>

* Currently, working on an analytics engine and monitoring tools at Bueno to shape the next generation of cloud-based
analytics using `Kotlin`, `Python`, `Typescript`, `Javascript` and Google cloud platform `GCP`.
* Contributed in developing a front-end asset and component library with `Typescript`, `React.js` and `Styled Components`
to enable fast iteration and immediate integration into any product.
* Worked in a team to deliver a large-scale issue management system and an insights monitoring tool using `Typescript`
and internal component library with automated deployments.
* Applied test-driven development, unit testing, integrated and end to end testing utilising `Enzyme`,
`React Testing` Library, `Cypress` and `Jest` frameworks.
* Applied a change data capture approach to offload a sizable amount of time-series data from a partitioned `PostgreSQL`
database into the GCP `BigQuery` using `Debezium`, Google Cloud `Pub/Sub` and `Dataflow`.
* Developed a database migration management tool in `Python` through versioned or repeatable data definition statements
for Google `BigQuery`.
* Made a fair amount of `UDF`s and `SQL` queries on `BigQuery` over tens of Terabytes data.
* Developed a module in `Kotlin` to forecast missing data of utility consumptions.
