  <b>Tabriz University of Medical Sciences</b>
</p>

* Designed and developed an app for research activities, Ravand, for the Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research at
Tabriz University of Medical Sciences using a hands-on `PHP` framework, `MySQL` database and pure `Javascript`. It
collects and organises the research activities of academic staff and analyses tens of thousands of research studies in
an integrated system.
* Was responsible for the fresh web design of the medical facultyâ€™s website.
* Implemented a simple network-based issue tracking system which enables faculty staff to report software problems or
upgrade requests from their computers.
