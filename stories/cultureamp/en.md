  <b>Culture Amp</b><br />
</p>

- Helping core services team to provide shared services that improve Culture Amp's
  ability to build new features and to operate, maintain, and grow the platform
  at scale.
- Contributed to the large portion of feature flag and toggle management project
  with LaunchDarkly provider including architectural decisions, flags provisioning
  and operations using `Golang`, `AWS CDK` and `Terraform`.
- Developed wrappers for LaunchDarklyâ€™s SDKs introducing client-side `JS` and `React`
  packages, and also server-side `Node.js` and `Golang` packages in order to abstract
  the initialisation process and create a uniform way of exposing user information
  back to LaunchDarkly.
- Contributed to the development of web hooks incorporating `event-driven` architecture
  of users and accounts synchronisation from internal platform to FusionAuth using
  `Golang`, `Apache Kafka` and `AWS` stack.
- Uplifted the existing sign-in user interface and fixed most of the stumbling
  blocks preventing first-time users from signing in to Culture Amp. Created a brand
  new mobile-first and responsive layout of Authentication UI using `Next.js`
  framework and `Typescript`. Conducted multiple sessions with our quality coaches
  and designers to ensure that the product delivered to our customers meet the
  quality standards.
- Contributed to decision-making framework to discover the next `React` app
  framework, making a new push to standardise the architecture and framework of
  front-end apps at Culture Amp. Investigated the feasibility and adoption of
  `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- Made discoveries around Auth0 and FusionAuth authentication providers. Developed
  demo React applications for each provider, presented findings with frontend
  practice group, and tested both providers from a front-end perspective.
- Mentored interns and new employees to give them context about Culture Amp in
  general and help them get successful onboarding process. The program was a
  good opportunity to develop my leadership skills and most importantly to
  amplify others.
