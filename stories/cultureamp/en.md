  <b>Culture Amp</b><br />
</p>

- Developed a mobile-first and responsive Authentication UI using the `Next.js`
  framework, `React` and `TypeScript`. Involved in the configuration and maintenance
  of the `FusionAuth` stack, ensuring robust support for the authentication UI.
  Worked closely with quality coaches and designers to ensure that the final product
  adhered to high quality standards.
- Contributed to the development of web hooks integrating an event-driven
  architecture for synchronising users and accounts from the internal platform to
  FusionAuth using `Golang`, `Apache Kafka` and `AWS` stack.
- Participated in the design and development of the Roles and Permissions UI using
  `React` and `Next.js`, along with a backend service utilising `Golang`. The initiative
  played a crucial role in standardising the management of roles and permissions
  across Culture Amp.
- Contributed to the large portion of feature flag and toggle management project
  with `LaunchDarkly` provider including architectural decisions, flags provisioning
  and operations using `Golang`, `AWS CDK` and `Terraform`. Additionally, played
  a role in developing a UI tailored for efficient management of toggles.
- Developed wrappers for LaunchDarklyâ€™s SDKs introducing client-side `JS` and
  `React` packages, and also server-side `Node.js` and `Golang` packages in order
  to abstract the initialisation process and create a uniform way of exposing user
  information back to LaunchDarkly.
- Explored and evaluated `Auth0` and `FusionAuth` as authentication providers,
  developing demo React applications for each. Presented insights and findings
  to the frontend practice group, and performed thorough front-end testing for
  both providers.
- Participated in the decision-making process to identify Culture Amp's next
  framework, aiming to standardise the architecture of front-end apps. Investigated
  the practicality and integration of `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- Actively mentored interns and new employees, facilitating successful onboarding
  and integration to Culture Amp. This role allowed me to hone my leadership
  skills and amplify the capabilities of others.
