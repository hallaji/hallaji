  <b>Culture Amp</b><br />
</p>

- Developed a mobile-first and responsive Authentication UI using the `Next.js`
  framework, `React.js` and `TypeScript`. Collaborated in the configuration and
  maintenance of the `FusionAuth` stack, ensuring robust backend support for the
  authentication UI. Worked closely with quality team and designers to ensure
  that the final product adhered to high quality standards.
- Contributed to the development of web hooks integrating an event-driven architecture
  for synchronising users and accounts from the internal platform to `FusionAuth`
  using `Golang`, `Apache Kafka` and `AWS` stack.
- Participated in the design and development of the Authorization service using
  `Next.js` and `React.js` in frontend, along with a backend service utilising
  `Golang` and `PostgreSQL`. The initiative played a crucial role in standardising
  the management of roles and permissions across Culture Amp.
- Contributed to the large portion of feature flag and toggle management project
  with `LaunchDarkly` provider including architectural decisions, flags provisioning
  and operations using `Golang`, `AWS CDK` and `Terraform`. Additionally, played
  a role in developing a UI tailored for efficient management of toggles.
- Developed wrapper libraries for LaunchDarklyâ€™s SDKs introducing client-side
  `JS` and `React` packages, and also server-side `Node.js`, `Golang` and `Kotlin`
  packages in order to abstract the initialisation process and create a uniform way
  of exposing user information back to LaunchDarkly.
- Undertook a thorough investigation of various Authentication and Authorization
  frameworks and providers, along with feature flag providers, assessing their
  suitability and compatibility with our systems and the specific needs of our projects.
- Participated in the decision-making process to identify Culture Amp's next
  framework, aiming to standardise the architecture of front-end apps. Investigated
  the practicality and integration of `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- Actively mentored interns and new employees, facilitating successful
  onboarding and integration to Culture Amp.
