[stories](https://hallaji.com/about), learn something new by writing [articles](https://hallaji.com/blog), think
aloud in my [diary](https://hallaji.com/diary), focus on  [what](https://hallaji.com/works) excites me and do so
with some style and passion. If you find anything you can improve, please feel free to submit an
