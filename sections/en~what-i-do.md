I make software. If you have a project or an idea that requires co-thinking or some creative injections, then that is
where you could count on me. I strive to create elegant looking apps and websites while making them simple for the
end-users. There is something very satisfying about creating things. I focus on what excites me and do so with some
style and passion. I am always active behind the scene of software products and enjoy programming. Currently, I am
working on a brand new backend infrastructure of the employee engagement and performance management solutions at
[CultureAmp](https://cultureamp.com) to amplify the experience and the impact of 100 million people at work ;‚èé
