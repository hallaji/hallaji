    title: Vahid Hallaji — Software Engineer
---

My name is **Vahid Hallaji**. I'm a software engineer from the lovely city
of Melbourne. I spend my days developing web and mobile stacks, but my passion for
coding started way back in the early 2000s when I stumbled upon the source code of
a blog! I couldn't resist taking a peek and have been hooked on software ever since.
I'm not just a one-trick pony, though! Whether it's front-end or back-end, I always
strive to use the best tools for the job. You might say I'm a bit of a “ruler” when
it comes to drawing the lines - in fact, that's been my nickname since childhood!
Back then, I was always the one to get things organised for outdoor games.
