My name is **Vahid Hallaji**. I am a software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia who develops web and mobile stacks.
I have studied Software Engineering and Master of Information Technology at Azad University and Monash University
respectively. Back in 2007, I co-founded [Narmand](http://narmand.com/) and got a valuable experience through
developing large-scale web applications for Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Besides, I worked in a team to
deliver dozens of websites and helped a few private businesses. I also attended meetups, mentored voluntarily at startup
weekends, and shared my personal experience with local communities.
