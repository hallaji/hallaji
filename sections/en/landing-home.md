    title: Vahid Hallaji — Software Engineer
---
My name is **Vahid Hallaji**. I am a software engineer based in Melbourne who develops web and mobile stacks. My lifelong passion for making software started when I happened to visit the source code of a blog back in the early 2000s. I just probed the source to satisfy my curiosity, and it continued throughout my life. I strive to use appropriate tools for the job regardless of its infrastructure, whether it is technically front end or back end. I got a nickname *“Ruler”* as I was the one to draw the lines for the outdoor games since my childhood.
